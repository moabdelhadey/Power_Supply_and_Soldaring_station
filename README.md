🔌 Power & Soldering Station
🧩 Overview
The Power & Soldering Station is a compact, laser-cut MDF workstation designed to simplify soldering and electronics work. It combines a convenient soldering area with a built-in power supply, providing fixed 5V and 12V outputs, and a variable 3.3–36V output using a Boost Converter. The variable output includes a digital volt/amp display, and the setup also features storage for tools and electronic components.

📐 Box Dimensions (MDF):

Height: 10 cm

Dedicated holder for the soldering iron.

Clamps to secure circuit boards during work.

🛠️ Tool Organization:
Top-facing slots for storing screwdrivers.

Four small compartments for organizing screws and small components.

⚡ Power Supply:
Fixed outputs: 5V and 12V from a repurposed PC power supply.

Variable output: Adjustable from 3.3V up to 36V using a Boost Converter.

Digital Display: Shows real-time voltage and current draw.

🎛️ Control Switches:
Main switch for turning the entire station on or off.

Switch for the side AC sockets.

Switch for the DC power section (fixed and variable outputs).

Switch for a small workspace light.

🪵 Custom MDF Enclosure:
Laser-cut MDF box designed for optimal layout and ease of use.

🔩 Components

Boost Converter (to produce a 3.3V–36V adjustable output).

Digital volt/amp meter for monitoring variable output.

Potentiometer for voltage control.

Soldering iron holder and board clamps.

Switches for main power, AC sockets, DC power, and light.

Side-mounted AC sockets.

Small workspace light.

MDF box (laser-cut).

Wires, terminals, and screws for internal connections.

🛠️ Assembly Instructions
1. 🧱 Prepare the MDF Box:
Cut the box using a laser cutter based on the design file (station-design.png).

Assemble the box using wood glue or screws.

2. 🔌 Install the Power Supply:
Mount the old PC power supply inside the box.

Route the 5V and 12V lines to the front panel terminals.

Use the 3.3V line to power the Boost Converter.

3. ⚙️ Configure the Variable Output:
Install the Boost Converter and wire it to the power supply.

Connect the potentiometer for output voltage adjustment.

Mount the digital volt/amp display and wire it accordingly (wiring-diagram.png).

4. 🔧 Set Up the Work Area:
Mount the soldering iron holder and PCB clamps on the top surface.

Add slots for screwdrivers and build the compartments for screws and small parts.

5. 🔘 Wire the Switches and Sockets:
Install the front panel switches.

Connect the AC sockets to the AC control switch.

Wire the work light to its dedicated switch.

6. 🧪 Final Testing:
Double-check wiring against wiring-diagram.png.

Power on the unit and test each function:

AC outlets

5V and 12V outputs

🔌 Usage
💡 Power Delivery:
Use 5V and 12V outputs for basic electronics.

Use the adjustable output for flexible voltage needs.

Monitor output voltage and current on the digital display.

Control AC loads using the side sockets and switch.

🔧 Soldering Tasks:
Clamp your circuit board securely.

Rest the iron safely in its holder.

Turn on the workspace light for better visibility.

🧰 Tool Management:
Store screwdrivers in the top-facing slots.

Use the compartments to keep small parts organized.

⚠️ Safety Notes
Ensure all wiring is well-insulated to prevent shorts.

Power the volt/amp meter separately if measuring beyond 36V (check wiring-diagram.png).

Test all connections before operation.

Always handle the soldering iron with care.
